	Abstract = {The early life microbiome plays critical roles in host development, shaping long-term outcomes including brain functioning. It is not known which initial infant colonizers elicit optimal neurodevelopment; thus, this study investigated the association between gut microbiome succession from the first week of life and head circumference growth (HCG), the earliest validated marker for neurodevelopment. Fecal samples were collected weekly from a preterm infant cohort during their neonatal intensive care unit stay and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing for evaluating gut microbiome composition, in conjunction with clinical data and head circumference measurements. Preterm infants with suboptimal HCG trajectories had a depletion in the abundance/prevalence of Bacteroidota and Lachnospiraceae, independent of morbidity and caloric restriction. The severity of gut microbiome depletion matched the timing of significant HCG pattern separation between study groups at 30-week postmenstrual age demonstrating a potential mediating relationship resultant from clinical practices. Consideration of the clinical variables indicated that optimal infant microbiome succession is primarily driven by dispersal limitation (i.e., delivery mode) and secondarily by habitat filtering (i.e., antibiotics and enteral feeding). Bacteroidota and Lachnospiraceae are known core taxa of the adult microbiome, with roles in dietary glycan foraging, beneficial metabolite production and immunity, and our work provides evidence that their integration into the gut microbiome needs to occur early for optimal neurodevelopment.},

	volume = {99},
	doi = {10.1093/femsec/fiad120},
	abstract = {Restoring ecosystems requires the re-establishment of diverse soil microbial communities that drive critical ecosystem functions. In grasslands, restoration and management require the application of disturbances like fire and grazing. Disturbances can shape microbial taxonomic composition and potentially functional composition as well. We characterized taxonomic and functional gene composition of soil communities using whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine how restored soil communities differed from pre-restoration agricultural soils and original remnant soils, how management affects soil microbes, and whether restoration and management affect the number of microbial genes associated with carbohydrate degradation. We found distinct differences in both taxonomic and functional diversity and composition among restored, remnant, and agricultural soils. Remnant soils had low taxonomic and functional richness and diversity, as well as distinct composition, indicating that restoration of agricultural soils does not re-create soil microbial communities that match remnants. Prescribed fire management increased functional diversity, which also was higher in more recently planted restorations. Finally, restored and post-fire soils included high abundances of genes encoding cellulose-degrading enzymes, so restorations and their ongoing management can potentially support functions important in carbon cycling.},

Here, we describe methods to directly observe the gliding motility machinery in Bacteroidota by transmission electron microscopy.},

            The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy includes organism names and classifications for every sequence in the nucleotide and protein sequence databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. Since the last review of this resource in 2012, it has undergone several improvements. Most notable is the shift from a single SQL database to a series of linked databases tied to a framework of data called NameBank. This means that relations among data elements can be adjusted in more detail, resulting in expanded annotation of synonyms, the ability to flag names with specific nomenclatural properties, enhanced tracking of publications tied to names and improved annotation of scientific authorities and types. Additionally, practices utilized by NCBI Taxonomy curators specific to major taxonomic groups are described, terms peculiar to NCBI Taxonomy are explained, external resources are acknowledged and updates to tools and other resources are documented.

	abstract = {The phylum Bacteroidota (synonym Bacteroidetes) is composed of three large classes of Gram-negative, nonsporeforming, anaerobic or aerobic, and rod-shaped bacteria that are widely distributed in the environment, including in soil, sediments, and sea water, as well as in the guts and on the skin of animals.
Although some Bacteroides spp. can be opportunistic pathogens, many Bacteroidota are symbiotic species highly adjusted to the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteroides are highly abundant in intestines, reaching up to 1011 cells g−1 of intestinal material. They perform metabolic conversions that are essential for the host, such as degradation of proteins or complex sugar polymers. Bacteroidota colonize the gastrointestinal tract already in infants, as non-digestible oligosaccharides in mother milk support the growth of both Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. Bacteroides spp. are selectively recognized by the immune system of the host through specific interactions.},
